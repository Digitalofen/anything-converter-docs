# Anything Converter – Privacy-First Hybrid Conversion

Anything Converter is a specialized tool designed to handle media and document conversions with a focus on data sovereignty and speed. 

## The Hybrid Model (90/10 Architecture)
To ensure maximum privacy, this tool uses a unique hybrid approach:

- **90% Local Processing (Client-Side):** Most conversions (Images, Audio, and Video via FFmpeg) are executed directly in your browser using **WebAssembly (WASM)**. Your files never leave your device.
- **10% Secure Server Fallback:** Complex document formats (via LibreOffice and Pandoc) are processed on our private, secure servers in **Austria (EU)**.

## Security & Privacy
- **Zero Data Retention:** Files processed on the server are automatically deleted after 5 minutes.
- **No Tracking:** No ads, no user tracking, and full GDPR compliance.
- **Expert-Built:** Developed from the daily needs of professional audio production.
